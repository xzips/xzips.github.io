Context:
For my first year university course, Structures and Materials (CIV102),
we were tasked with designing and building a beam bridge of length 1200mm using
a limited amount of matboard (similar to cardboard), and glue. Given the imposed
limitations, the optimal bridge configuration was not obvious.

Summary:

In order to assist my team in designing a near-optimal bridge, I built this
graphical tool in pure C++ (with a graphics library) to implement everything
I had learned this semester regarding the behaviour of structures. The tool
features an interactive bridge cross section(the main design space) editor,
with live calculations and feedback for bridge safety factor, and failure mode
based on a 3D simulation of internal and external stresses on the structure.
13(check) types of failure and internal stresses were included in the simulation.
The simulation accurately predicted the failure load of the bridge when it was tested,
to within ~14%
