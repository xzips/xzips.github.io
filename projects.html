                            <div class="project-description-text">
                            
                            My Engineering Design class required that the student body reach out to various community organizations in Toronto to better understand their current challanges and areas of 
                            improvement. Among the organizations we and our peers reached out to, the Annex Cat Rescue stood out to us as a group of animal-lovers. Annex Cat Rescue is a non-profit that
                            aims to capture stray cats and provide them with necessary medical care, and then find them a permenant home.
                            <br><br>

                            Through meetings with organization representitives, we learned that that volunteers spent a significant amount of time and resources simply waiting by cat traps, as they
                            were either manually actuated, or had to be checked on a regular basis. This time commitment was a significant limiting factor in the number of cats that could be captured and thus
                            the effectiveness of the organization.

                            After high-level concept brainstorming, we had two possible ideas to proceed with. Both involved sensor-based detecion, with different methods of acutating the trap to close.
                            In order to better evaluate these two concepts, I decided to build a low-fidelity prototype of each, seen below.

                            We learned from these prototypes that the gravity door drop concept was significantly more reliable in the actuation mechanism,
                            allowed a larger entrance for the cat, and while requiring slightly more complex construction, would ultimately be more effective
                            especially on a larger scale when the trap weighs more. <br><br>

                            Proceeding with the gravity door concept, we decided to use lock solenoids to hold the door open, then apply a current to the solenoid to release the door when required.
                            From our testing in the low-fidelity phase, we learned that the PIR motion sensor was prone to false positives, and as such we opted to use an ultrasonic distance sensor instead
                            for the final design, to ensure accurate cat-detection, and thus safety. <br><br>

                            Concerning the alert system, we considered email, sms, a loud noise, and a light. We decided that noises and lights would be too distruptive to the surroundings, and potentially
                            uncomfortable for the now-trapped cat. Ultimately SMS through a 4G module was chosen, as it was the most reliable and cross-platform method of alerting volunteers. <br><br>

                            In terms of linking a device to the trap, we decided to include a screen and buttons on the trap itself to initialize pairing instructions with a phone (sending a verification
                            code to the traps number), ensuring that there is only ever one phone linked to a trap at a time, and can be easily transfered to another phone as needed. <br><br>

                            Finally, for the microcontroller we opted for the Raspberry Pi, as it's a verastile and powerful platform which I am familar with. <br><br>


                            Additional design details including power-delivery and physical construction are omitted for brevity, but my design decisions
                            always prioritized reliability of electronics, robustness of mechanichal systems, and always-bolt never-glue construction.

                            Below is a series of CAD renders I made of the final conceptual design, before building it.

                            I built the final prototype one subsytem at a time, integrating everything at the end and then performing system-wide testing and debugging. This approach proved effective as I was
                            able to compartmentalize the project into separate tasks and with pre-defined cross-system interfaces (power, communication, mechanichal linkage, etc).<br><br>

                            At the end of the 6 weeks, my team's design and prototyping work concluding with the Showcase event, where all groups presented their final designs and results to
                            the course instructors, along with the organization representitives. We performed a live demonstration allowing the representitve to pair their own phone to the trap,
                            and then see it in action. The representitive was very impressed with our design, and mentioned that it was a significant improvement over the current manual traps.

                            Additionally, the course instructors were impressed with our design, and we recieved a final grade grade of 100% for the project, which comprised a significant
                            (25%) portion of our final grade in the course.
