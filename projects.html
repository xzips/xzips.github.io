                by date of completion, with the most recent at the top, and the color tab indicates the time commitment of the project.

                                    <li> Once all the connection data was gathered, various graph analysis algorithms were used from the "networkx" library to quantify the degree of connection between account IDs</li>

                                    <li> Python was used for all programming aspects, and the "requests library" we used at first </li>
                                    
                                    <li> However, for the second phase of determing account connections, significantly more requests were needed. In order to bypass website rate limits, the "cfscrape" library was used  </li>

                                    <li> In order to further improve data collection speed, the code was compartmentilized and distributed to multiple cores using the "multiprocessing" python module</li>

                                    <li> Once all the connection data was gathered, various graph analysis algorithms were used from the "networkx" library to quantify the degree of connection between account IDs</li>

                                    <li> Using the new list of account IDs, the they were rescraped for the additional data necessary to determine action consensus</li>

                                    <li> Finally, the "pandas" library was used to export the results into an excel spreadsheet, and some manual formatting changes were made before presentation</li>

                                </ul>
